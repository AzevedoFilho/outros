Option 1: SSH with X11 Forwarding
Connect to the EC2 host using SSH with X11 forwarding enabled.

ssh -X 13.57.185.127
In the resulting session you should find that the DISPLAY environment variable is set.

echo $DISPLAY
With this in place you can launch an application on the remote host and it will show up on your local desktop. Try starting gvim (assuming that you have it installed).

Option 2: Remote Desktop
Connect via SSH.
Install a few packages.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ubuntu-desktop xrdp
Edit the RDP configuration file, /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini, on the host. Note the entry for port, which will be important for making a connection. A minimal configuration might look like this:

[globals]
bitmap_cache=yes
bitmap_compression=yes
port=3389
crypt_level=low
channel_code=1
max_bpp=24

[xrdp1]
name=sesman-Xvnc
lib=libvnc.so
username=ask
password=ask
ip=127.0.0.1
port=ask-1
In the AWS Dashboard edit the Security Group for the EC2 instance and allow inbound TCP connections on port 3389.

Restart RDP.

sudo service xrdp restart
Choose the Window Manager for RDP connections. This involves changing the contents of a user’s .xsession file. You can copy the modified .xsession into /etc/skel/ so that it will be propagated into any newly created accounts. However, you’ll need to copy it manually into existing accounts.

Select one of the Window Manager options below (there are certainly other options too!).

XFCE
sudo apt install -y xfce4 xfce4-goodies
echo xfce4-session >~/.xsession
Unity
echo unity >~/.xsession
You’re ready to connect!

On a Linux machine, connect using vinagre. You’ll need to specify the IP address for the EC2 host and the RDP port.
